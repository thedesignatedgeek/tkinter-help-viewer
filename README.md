# tkinter-help-viewer
Generic help viewer using a Tkinter Textbox Widget and Page GUI designer

This project is currently under development, so no code here yet.

Eventually, the viewer will be able to display \*.md and \*.rst files in a Tkinter Textbox Widget almost as if viewing a HTML file.
The GUI form will actually be generated by _Page - A GUI Designer for Python_.  Once this project is created, this module set can then be called from your Page GUI project.

With any luck, I will be able to provide a combobox widget on the form to provide a quick table of contents jump to.

If everything works well, this project will be included in my upcoming book _learning Page: A GUI Designer for Python_.

Wish me luck.
